# ADHD_Symptom_Tracker
This project is designed to help me track which methods of coping mechanisms help me with handling and managing ADHD

This application employs a list with a search functionality where you can look for specific items quickly. The purpose is to help someone log how they're feeling and tie it to any specific events and what could trigger such events.
It's simple, but effective.
